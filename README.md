A set of tools to convert Halo Custom Edition tags to and from YAML.

## What is this for?

Halo's tags are stored as binary files. This causes two problems that make
modern git workflows nearly impossible:
1. Tag files (and changes to them) are not viewable in version control.
2. If two people modify the same tag file, they must open both tags in an editor
and manually reconcile the changes.

Librarian exists to address these problems.
